# Python-code-examples
Several examples of graph algorithms in Python.

In the first example, data is read from a Pajek file
and transformed into matrices and a list.

The second example contains implementations of Prim and Kruskal algorithms,
which read data from a .txt file and give us the time needed for the completion of the algorithms.

The third example takes the nodes in a graph and gives us
input/output values of said nodes.
